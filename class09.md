**Chapter 7: “Forms”**
Form is an Element <form> that stores all the information from a user input in html. Information in a form is set in name/value pairs.

A name is given to each form and values are the information user inputs which are then sent to servers.

**Chapter 14: “Lists, Tables & Forms”**

In addition to modifying contents of an element, CSS also allows us to control the appearance of lists,tables and forms.

List can be given different appearances using list-style-type and list-style image properties.

Forms are easier to control when the controls are aligned vertically using CSS.

Forms give more interacting and style to a webpage.

**Chapter 6: “Events”**

Events are broswers way to indicating when something happens in that page.

Binding lets us know which event is waiting to happen and which element is waiting for that even to happen upon.

A JavaScript function is triggered when an event occurs which then changes the webpage in someway to make it more interactive to end users.

Delegation can be used to monitor events.

Commonly used events are W3C DOM events.
