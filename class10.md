**Ch. 10, “Error Handling & Debugging”**

Debugging is the process of finding errors and fixing them. One of the many ways to find an error is via console., which helps us locate where the error lies and at what line.

JavaScript has 7 different types of errors:

1. Range error: This happens when number is outside of a given range.

2. Reference error: This error is thrown when a reference is made to a variable that is broken.

3. Syntax error: This is usually the most common error. this could be a missing brackets or semicolon etc.

4. TypeError: This happens when an operand is performed in a wrong data type. for example 

let x = 2;
x.toUpperCase()

5. URIError: This happens when a function is called with wrong parameters.

6. Eval Error:This is used to locate errors when using global eval function.

7. Internal error: This happens within JS when there is too much data generating. A infinite loop could be an example.
