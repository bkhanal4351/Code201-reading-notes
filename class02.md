CSS(Cascading Style Sheets) is a design language used to simplify the process of making web pages presentable. CSS gives the look and feel part of a web page. CSS can be used to color the text, change fonts, change background colors, how columns are sized, where to position the text/images, padding etc.

There are three ways to insert style sheet.

1. External CSS: By just chaging one file, you can change the look of an entire website.

2. Internal CSS: The internal style is defined inside the element, inside head section. example: <style> body { background-color: red; }
h1 { color: yellow; margin-left: 50px; } </style>

3. Inline CSS An inline style is used to apply a unique style for a single element.
